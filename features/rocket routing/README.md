You got it. Here is the `README.md` for the "Priority 'Rocket' Routing" script, presented in the final format you requested.

# üöÄ Priority ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù Routing - Terminal Version

This Python script is a proof-of-concept for a **smart traffic routing system**. It uses a time-series approach with a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network to predict future traffic congestion and find the estimated fastest route, including a simulated **"Rocket Mode"** for high-priority trips.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Synthetic Traffic Data:** Generates 1000 hours of realistic, cyclical traffic data for multiple zones (`Zone_A`, `Zone_B`, `Zone_C`).
  * **Time-Series Prediction:** Trains a simple **LSTM model** using TensorFlow/Keras to forecast the next hour's congestion level based on the past 24 hours of data.
  * **Dynamic Route Calculation:** Calculates travel time for route segments by dynamically reducing vehicle speed based on the **predicted congestion**.
  * **"Rocket Mode" Simulation:** Includes a feature that applies a $\mathbf{20\%}$ travel time reduction to simulate a high-priority, expedited service.
  * **Route Comparison:** Compares two predefined routes and outputs the fastest option in both normal and rocket modes.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

You must have **Python 3.x** installed along with the following libraries. They are all standard components for data science and machine learning in Python.

| Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`numpy`** | Core library for numerical operations. |
| **`pandas`** | Data manipulation and time-series handling. |
| **`tensorflow` / `keras`** | Building, training, and running the LSTM neural network. |

You can install all dependencies with one command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow
```

-----

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Save the entire code block as a Python file (e.g., `rocket_router.py`).
2.  Execute the script directly from your terminal:

<!-- end list -->

```bash
python rocket_router.py
```

### Example Output

The script will first generate data and train the model, then proceed to the route comparisons:

```

## üß† Code Architecture Summary

The script follows a clear, linear pipeline:

1.  **Data Generation:** The `generate_traffic_data()` function creates the time-series input.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The `preprocess_for_lstm()` function prepares the data by:
      * **Filtering** to a single zone (`Zone_A` is used for training).
      * **Encoding** the hour using sine and cosine functions to handle cyclical time.
      * Creating $\mathbf{24}$-hour sequences as input features.
3.  **Model Training:** A simple **LSTM** network is compiled with an $\text{Adam}$ optimizer and $\text{MSE}$ loss, then trained on the $\text{Zone A}$ sequences.
4.  **Prediction:** The `predict_congestion()` function uses the trained model to forecast the future congestion level for any given zone.
5.  **Route Calculation:** The `simulate_route()` function calculates the total journey time by factoring in the segment length, base speed, and the predicted congestion level.
      * **Congestion Penalty:** High congestion significantly reduces the effective travel speed.
6.  **Comparison:** The main block runs both predefined routes in both travel modes (Normal and Rocket) to determine and print the **optimal path**.

Would you like to explore how to extend this model to **train on all zones** simultaneously, which would improve prediction accuracy across the entire routing network?
